# Configuration-only servers.  You can use one of these to support Microsoft's 
# three node limit for Availabiliy Groups (AGs) on Linux, even if you only 
# have two syncronous replicas.  Configuration replicas can use a no-charge SQL 
# Server Express license for the third node. It's only used by the AG to 
# maintain internal quorum.  There's no replication to the node and you'll 
# never actually fail over to it.

# declare -A CONFIG_ONLY_SERVERS_PASS=(["sql7"]="passwd6")
